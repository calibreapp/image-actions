# Image actions

Image actions will automatically compress jpeg, png and webp images in GitHub Pull Requests.

- **Compression is fast, efficient and near-lossless**
- Uses mozjpeg + libvips, the best image compression available
- Runs in GitHub Actions, so it's visible to everyone
- Configurable: Use the great defaults or change to suit your needs

## How to add this to your repository:

- Add the following steps to a workflow file found at: `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` (If you don’t have one, create it.)
- Paste in the following:

```yml
name: 'Compress images'
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: calibreapp/image-actions
        uses: docker://calibreapp/github-image-actions
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is [automatically managed by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret). You do not have to manually create this secret. This automatic token is [scoped only to the repository that is currently running the action.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#token-permissions)

## Configuration

By default, you probably don’t need to configure image-actions. However, if you’d like to ignore certain file paths, or change image compression options, read on.

Configuration can be set by adding a `.github/calibre/image-actions.yml` file:

```yml
jpeg:
  quality: 80
png:
  quality: 80
webp:
  quality: 80
ignorePaths:
  - "node_modules/**"
```

- The above configuation is what image-actions uses by default
- The `jpeg`, `png` and `webp` config keys will be delivered directly into [sharp’s](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) `toFormat`. ([JPEG options](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg), [PNG options](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png), [Webp options](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp))
- `ignorePaths` allows for path globbing. [See the glob package for more details.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob)
