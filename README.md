# Image Actions

Image Actions automatically compress JPEG, PNG and WebP images in GitHub Pull Requests.

- **Fast, efficient and near-lossless compression**
- Uses the best image compression algorithms available: [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) and [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips)
- Configurable and extensible: use default settings or adapt to your needs
- Runs in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Built by web performance experts at [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/); a  performance monitoring platform

## Add Image Actions to your repository

1. Open or create the `.github/workflows/calibreapp-image-actions.yml` file.
2. Paste in the following:

```yml
name: Compress images
on: pull_request
jobs:
  build:
    name: calibreapp/image-actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Compress Images
        uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
        with:
          githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is [automatically generated by GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#github_token-secret). This automatic token is [scoped only to the repository that is currently running the action.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#token-permissions)

## Configure Image Actions

By default, you probably don’t need to configure `image-actions`. 
However, if you’d like to ignore specific file paths, or change image compression options, read on.

Change the configuration options by adding arguments to the action:

```yml
- name: Compress Images
  uses: calibreapp/image-actions@master
  with:
    githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    jpegQuality: "80"
    pngQuality: "80"
    webpQuality: "80"
    ignorePaths: "node_modules/**,build"
    # No spaces allowed
```

Previous versions of image-actions used `.github/config/image-actions.yml` for configuration. 
If you're still using that configuration method we suggest that you update it.

- The above configuration is what `image-actions` uses by default
- The `jpegQuality`, `pngQuality` and `webpQuality` config keys will be delivered directly into [sharp’s](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com) `toFormat`. ([JPEG options](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#jpeg), [PNG options](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#png), [Webp options](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-output/#webp))
- `ignorePaths` allows for path globbing [see the glob package for more details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob)

## Running the action only when images are changed

`image-actions` is designed to run for each Pull Request. In some repositories, images are seldom updated. To run the action only when images have changed, use GitHub Action’s [`on.push.paths`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) workflow configuration:

```yml
name: Compress images
on: 
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.jpg'
      - '**.png'
      - '**.webp'
```

The above workflow will only run when `jpg`, `png` or `webp` files are changed.
